title: Captain Fletcher's Private Reserve
description: |-
  Charles Fletcher, a sailor, ship's carpenter, and whale boat captain, was the
    first settler of what became the town of Navarro near the mouth of the Navarro
    River. Captain Fletcher was highly respected as a businessman and as a
    citizen. He was generous with his employees, large hearted, fearless, and
    honest, he was a representative type of the hardy pioneers of this state.


    Navarro-by-the-Sea Center is a public benefit nonprofit corporation. The specific purposes for which this corporation is organized are: to promote education and interpretive activities of the California State Parks system in the Mendocino County area, support scientific and historic investigations relating to the area, and present these subjects to the public.


    Our primary focus since incorporation has been preservation and rehabilitation of the historic Captain Fletcher's Inn (ca. 1865) at the Navarro Beach area of the Navarro River Redwoods State Park.
